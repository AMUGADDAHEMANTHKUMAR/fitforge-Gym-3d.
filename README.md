**FitForge 3D – Your Gateway to Fitness Communities**
*Created with Lovable and Superb*

FitForge 3D is a modern web application built to simplify the way new members join fitness communities. Designed using the intuitive **Lovable** platform, it offers a seamless and user-friendly experience.

### 🏋️ How It Works:

1. **New Member Registration**
   When a new user or gym enthusiast visits the site, they can easily register by entering their **name** and selecting the **type of membership** they’re interested in—whether it's monthly, yearly, or custom.

2. **Instant Communication with Gym Owner**
   Once the form is submitted, the details are instantly forwarded to the gym owner. This allows the owner to review the request and reach out directly to the user.

3. **Connect on WhatsApp**
   For faster interaction, users can simply click the **WhatsApp link** provided on the site to chat directly with the gym owner—no delays, no confusion.
